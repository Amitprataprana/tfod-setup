# Steps to train the your tfod model on colab - 

Steps to start training in colab for tfod-

1. Do all the necessary steps shown by Paul in Saturday's lecture in your local system except the last step where training starts... 
I mean do everything before the following step-
    ```
    python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssdlite_mobilenet_v1_coco.config
    ```

2. Now move all the tfod folder to ur google drive.

3. Now open a jupyter notebook in the root of your folder structure. I mean just inside the tfod folder.

4. Mount the drive in Colab and initialize it with GPU.

5. In the first cell run %tensorflow_version 1.x so that it selects TensorFlow 1 for the training.

6. In the notebook import os. And set a path to the research directory in a Variable.

7. run os.chdir(RESEARCH_FOLDER_PATH). to change the directory

8. run os.getcwd() to verify that u are in the research folder

9. Now run the training command - 
```
!python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssdlite_mobilenet_v1_coco.config
```

10. copy and paste following code in ur browser console to prevent it from terminating- 
```javascript
function ClickConnect(){
console.log("Working"); 
document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button").click() 
}setInterval(ClickConnect,60000)
```
