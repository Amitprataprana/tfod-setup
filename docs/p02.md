# Steps to train the your tfod model on colab - 

Steps to start training in colab for tfod-

#### 1. Do all the necessary steps shown in the previous page in your local system except the last step where training starts-

!!! note
    I mean do everything before the following step-
    ```
    python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssdlite_mobilenet_v1_coco.config
    ```

---

#### 2.Move whole tfod folder to your google drive.

---

#### 3. Open a jupyter notebook in the root of your folder structure. I mean just inside the tfod folder.

---

#### 4. Mount the drive in Colab and initialize it with GPU.

---

#### 5. In the first cell run the following command so that it selects TensorFlow 1 for the training-

```
%tensorflow_version 1.x
```

---

#### 6. In the notebook import os. And set a path to the research directory in a Variable.

```python hl_lines="2"
import os
RESEARCH_DIR = "/content/drive/My Drive/PATH_TO_TFOD/tfod/models-1.13.0/research"
```

---

#### 7. Run the following line to change the directory-

```python
os.chdir(RESEARCH_FOLDER_PATH)
```

---

#### 8. Run the following line to verify that u are in the research folder-

```python
os.getcwd()
```

---

#### 9. Now run the training command to start the training in Colab- 

!!! Note
    Change the name of config file as per your model name  
    ```
    !python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssdlite_mobilenet_v1_coco.config
    ```

---


#### 10. Copy and paste following code in your browser console to prevent it from terminating- 
```javascript
function ClickConnect(){
console.log("Working"); 
document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button").click() 
}setInterval(ClickConnect,60000)
```
